- 👋 Hi, I’m @splatton
- 👀 I’m interested in healthcare data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about different ML algorithms with a focus in R. I'm also learning about information theory and brushing up on my linear algebra.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project in healthcare that's interesting. I have a particular interest in Emergency Medicine, as well as projects that advocate for patient safety or physician empowerment.
